Magicrap: A Platforming Game

How to Build:
Building requires the additional libsdl2-image-dev and libsdl2-ttf-dev
packages. To install these, simply type the following into the terminal:

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

How to Play:
Navigate the Koffing to the door at the top while avoiding the Magikarps and
collecting as many coins as possible. Hold down the left or right keys to move
the Koffing in that direction. When reaching a ladder, simply tap the key and
you will move up the ladder. At any point in the game, you can press the "p"
key to pause (you will become invulnerable to the Magikarps), or the "q" key
to completely quit the game.

On Sprite Licensing:
The sprites in this game were taken from Pok√©mon, Undertale, and Donkey Kong.
